### Original Formulation

\<blockquote\> The ontology has a clearly specified and clearly
delineated content.

The ontology must be orthogonal to other ontologies already lodged
within OBO.

The major reason for this principle is to allow two different
ontologies, for example anatomy and process, to be combined through
additional relationships. These relationships could then be used to
constrain when terms could be jointly applied to describe complementary
(but distinguishable) perspectives on the same biological or medical
entity.

As a corollary to this, we would strive for community acceptance of a
single ontology for one domain, rather than encouraging rivalry between
ontologies.
