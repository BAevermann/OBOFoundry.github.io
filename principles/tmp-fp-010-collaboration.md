commitment to collaboration

Details
-------

It is assumed that OBO Foundry ontology development, like all scientific
activity, is carried out in a collaborative fashion. The OBO Foundry
requires in addition that each OBO Foundry ontology is maintained in
such a way as to ensure consistency with neighboring OBO Foundry
ontologies and to ensure use of relevant content from these neighboring
ontologies, for example in formulation of cross-product definitions.
