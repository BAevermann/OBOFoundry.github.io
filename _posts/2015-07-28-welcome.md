Welcome to the new OBO Foundry site. THIS SITE IS STILL PROVISIONAL.

The new site incorporates a number of improvements from the old legacy site:

 * A richer ontology registry that allows us to capture more information about an ontology
 * A more modern underlying infrastructure (GitHub pages) that allow us to be more responsive
 * The ability for ontology maintainers to edit their own metadata and submit pull requests

## Ontology Datamodel

In the old site, every ontology project was associated with exactly
one "file" that represented their ontology. This was later partially
extended to allow for both obo and owl versions of an ontology, but
this part never worked particularly well.
