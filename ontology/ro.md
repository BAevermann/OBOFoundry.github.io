The Cell Ontology is designed as a structured controlled vocabulary for cell types. This ontology was constructed for use by the model organism and other bioinformatics databases, where there is a need for a controlled vocabulary of cell types. This ontology is not organism specific it covers cell types from prokaryotes to mammals. However, it excludes plant cell types, which are covered by PO.
