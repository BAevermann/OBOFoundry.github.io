An ontology based on the consent codes decsription from the Dyke et al. paper at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005772. It allows to semantically tag datasets with restriction about their usage, making them discoverable automatically based on the authorization level of users, or intended usage.
This resource is based on the OBO Foundry principles, and its use is under review by the Broad Institute ad the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) at EMBL-EBI.
