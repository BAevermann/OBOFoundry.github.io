Members of the OBO Foundry Operations Committee aim at improving flow of operations and making things happen within the [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org), in collaboration with the [OBO Foundry Coordinating Editors](http://obofoundry.org/coordination.shtml) and external invited experts. Such operations include, but are not limited to, establishment of policies, review of resources, outreach and education.

- [Editorial Working Group](EditorialWG.html) Editorial WG is involved in reviewing OBO Foundry ontologies and policy setting. Primary tasks are to conduct reviews, but also include all activities that enable that process, such as tool building for automated validation, website maintenance of the review results, or leading calls and taking notes.

- [Technical Working Group](TechnicalWG.html) The OBOFOC Technical WG is involved in maintaining the technical infrastructure for the OBO Foundry. This includes establishment of policies to be implemented in common tools, website maintenance, calls, etc.

- [Outreach Working Group](OutreachWG.html) The OBO Foundry Outreach WG is involved in public relations for the OBO Foundry. This includes monitoring and following up discussions on mailing lists, preparing documentation and educational materials, and presenting OBO Foundry activities at workshops, conferences, or other venues.

See a description of our activities in our [mission statement](MissionStatement.html).
